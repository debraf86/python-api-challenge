Trends/Analysis

The max temperatures are not at the equator as one would think but on the tropical regions. 
A high density of clouds in equatorial regions is one of the reasons why they get plenty of rain every year.
These rains help keep the temperatures lower on the equator.
Most deserts are located in tropical regions, slightly off the Equator which is why they have lower humidity.
